This was my first attempt at making an open-world space exploration game, where you could travel to different systems, customize the weapons/equipment of your ship, and make allies and enemies of various factions.

Used music from FTL: Faster Than Light as placeholder tracks, which have been replaced on uploading here for copyright reasons.
